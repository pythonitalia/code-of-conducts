## Longer version

stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Any content or activity featuring, encouraging, or soliciting illegal activity (for example sharing
pirated content) is prohibited.

People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
